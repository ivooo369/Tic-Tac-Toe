# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my recreation of the famous Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Features:

- Both players can choose their names and signs from the starting page;
- There are several counters available: the total number of rounds played, the number of ties, and the wins for each player;
- There is a panel indicating whose turn it is currently;
- After each game, players have the option to choose whether they want to play another round or start a completely new game with different names;

In the future, I can explore the possibility of adding an AI opponent that competes against the player.

## Used technologies:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
